The cryptocurrency market has evolved significantly over the past decade, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge as the two most prominent cryptocurrencies.

In this detailed analysis, I’ll walk you through the data trends for both Bitcoin and Ethereum from 2014–2024 and 2017–2024, respectively.

Using Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and Power Query, I gathered data to uncover key insights into their price movements, trading volumes, and forecast trends for the future.

Data Source and Methodology
Over the past few days, I’ve conducted a deep analysis of the price trends of Bitcoin (2014–2024) and Ethereum (2017–2024) measured by Open, Close, Adjusted Close, High, Low and Volume traded per day.

The analysis leverages a reputable cryptocurrency platform’s historical pricing and trading volume data. The source of the dataset is Kaggle.

The raw data was imported into Microsoft Excel and cleaned using Power Query.

Finally, Power BI was used to visualize trends and develop forecasts, offering a comprehensive picture of how Bitcoin and Ethereum have performed over the years and what we can expect moving forward.
